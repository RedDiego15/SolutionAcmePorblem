## Solution Overview

"In order to effectively address the problem at hand, I first identified the specific requirements and objectives. I then conducted a thorough analysis of the expected outcomes and formulated a design plan based on a modular architecture. I also incorporated three design patterns that I believed would be most suitable for the task. Through this process, I was able to develop a comprehensive and reliable solution that met all the necessary requirements using a modular architecture and the selected design patterns."

## Architecture explanation

The modular architecture was adopted for this solution due to its ability to decompose the system into smaller, independent components. These components are more amenable to testing and maintenance, and, upon identification of the requirements, can be tailored to specific functions. As a result, the modular architecture was deemed the most suitable approach for this project.

## Aproach and methodology

In my approach, I utilized design patterns to ensure that the program could accommodate additional functions or changes to inputs. To do this, I followed the following steps:

    1. I compiled a list of requirements '

    2. created a UML diagram to abstractly represent the modules that would be necessary.

    3. I identified design patterns that could be applied to these modules to facilitate scalability and maintainability.

    4. I implemented tests to validate the effectiveness of the chosen design patterns.
